## Sofias Portfolio

This weeks project was to create a portfolio built with HTML and CSS, using flexbox. The page should be fully responsible, look and function the same on Chrome, Firefox and Edge. It should also work well for people who use screen readers and keyboard navigation and the code should validate in a validation tool.

## The problem

I started out by watching and reading material focusing on accessability and then started to build my page according to design guidelines. Several times during the project I used a validation tool to make sure my page fulfills the requirements.

If I had more time I would work more on the design and structure and minimize css code. Also added buttons for github-site and for the deployed site. To give the reader the two options.
